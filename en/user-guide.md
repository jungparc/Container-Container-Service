Enter the required information and click **Create Template** button to create Template.

> [Caution]
> When a container (task) is restarted due to an NCS environment check or a temporary error, the created logs and data inside the container are initialized. For data that must be maintained after restart, use NAS storage.

> [Note]
> You can add only one port of the same protocol to Template.
> TCP and HTTP, HTTPS, and TERMINATED_HTTPS cannot use the same port.
> Using the HTTP and TERMINATED_HTTPS protocols adds an X-Forwarded-For Header that allows the load balancer to identify the Client IP.

> [Note]
> Each container is provided with 20 GB of ephemeral storage. If you exceed the provided usage, the container is restarted and the ephemeral storage is reset.

> [Note]
> The file and confidential data use the information from when the template was created. If the original file or secret data is modified, the information in the already created template is not affected.
> Files are only accessible to the project Object Storage within the same organization. 
> Confidential data utilizes Secure Key Manager in the same project. To use confidential data, you must first enable the Secure Key Manager service.

> If the workload change fails (for example, an image error), the change attempt is terminated and no job replacement occurs.

### Stop/Restart Workload
If you stop a workload, all tasks in the workload will end.

If you restart a workload, the container IP and load balancer IP are changed while the floating IP and URL are maintained.

> [Caution]
> Logs, events, and ephemeral storage are initialized when the workload is stopped.
> Even if you stop the workload, the scheduled execution history is deleted during the task repeat cycle.

### Delete Workload

Select a workload you want to delete and click **Delete Workload** button to proceed with the deletion.

## NCS Role
You can set NCS roles to control which roles can access services and resources.
For example, you can set an "NCS administrator" to have the ability to create, view, and manage templates and workloads, while an "NCS user" can only have the view role for templates and workloads.

### Add NCS Execution Role
Set the role to execute NCS in the NHN Cloud Console screen.
1. Select **Manage Member** in the **Project Management** screen.
2. Click a member that you want to change the role.
3. Click **Add Role** to add roles for each service.
  * Select the basic infrastructure service in the left area, then select the role in the right area.
4. You can view the selected roles to add or delete them.
5. Click **Add** to apply the changed roles to the project members.
6. Once a role is added, you can select a member to view the detailed role history.

For more information on how to use role group, see the console guide.

### Details of Role
To use NCS, you need roles for the following resources.
* NCS - Allows you to view, create, and manage resources in the NCS.
* Infrastructure - Allows NCS users to lookup VPC, Subnet resources. This is required when looking up templates and workloads in NCS.
* Load Balancer - Allows NCS users to create and manage Infrastructure Load Balancer resources. This is required when using a Load Balancer for a workload in NCS.
* Security Group - Allows NCS users to create and manage Infrastructure Security Group resources. This is required when using Security Groups for templates in NCS.

### Assign Minimum Roles for NCS
In a production environment, it is recommended to add only the roles you need. The minimum roles to use the NCS service are as follows.

| Features | Infrastructrue NCS ADMIN | Infrastructrue MEMBER | Infrastructrue Security Group ADMIN | Infrastructrue Load Balancer ADMIN |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Retrieve Template |  | O |  |  |
| Create Template | O |  | O |  |
| Delete Template | O |  | O |  |
| Retrieve Workload |  | O |  |  |
| Create and Change Workload | O |  | O | O |
| Delete Workload | O |  | O | O |

## Other considerations

### Region

* NCS service is only available in Korea (Pangyo) and Korea (Gwangju) regions.

### Resource Provision Policy
* Refer to [ NHN Container Service Resource Provision Policy](/nhncloud/en/resource-policy/#nhn-container-servicencs).

### Template/Container

* Containers described in Template must be configured to use different container ports.
* If you connect directly to Container Port, make sure that Security Group is well set up.
* You cannot create Load Balancer if you use Template that does not specify Container Port.
* You can create containers by utilizing Container images that exist in the following Private Registry.
* Containers can be created by using container images that exist in private registries. The supported source registry types, URLs, Access IDs, and Access Secrets are as follows.

| Source Registry Type | Access ID | Access Secret |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Container Registry | Access Key User Name | Access Key Password |
| Google Cloud Container Registry | \_json\_key | Private key of service account (JSON type) |
| Docker Hub | Username | Password |
| Harbor | Username | Password |
| Quay | json\_file | {<br>"account\_name": "$User account",<br>"docker\_cli\_password": "Encrypted Password generated by $Quay"<br>} |

* Within Container image, you must match Container Port in the Template with the Port that the Container decides to use for service.
    * If you use default nginx Container image that is designated to serve 80 ports, you have to specify 80 for the Container Port. If you change the content of Container image and set it up to serve another Port, you have to specify that Port number.
* The file and confidential data use the information from when the template was created. If the original file or confidential data is modified, the information in the already created template is not affected.
    * To update the contents of a file or confidential data and reflect those changes, you need to create a new template and run the workload.

### GPU

* Provides MIG(Multi Instance GPU of A100 40GB Card.
* For details, refer to the following links.
    * [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/technologies/multi-instance-gpu/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/technologies/multi-instance-gpu/)
    * [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/)
* GPU CUDA version is 11.7.
* GPU Driver version is 515.86.01.
* Container can only use one type of GPU.
* Available GPU types are as follows.

| Category | Type | Name | RAM | Number of GPUs | MIG Profile Name |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Graphics Optimized | ncs1 | ncs1.g1m5 | 5GB | 1 | MIG 1g.5gb |
| Graphics Optimized | ncs1 | ncs1.g2m10 | 10GB | 2 | MIG 2g.10gb |

## Guide to Problem Solving

Explain how to solve various problems that may occur while using the NCS service

### Workload

* A container event with **FailedCreatePodSandBox**/**CNITimedOutWaitingForVIFs** type occurs when the workload is created normally, and the container is running properly
    * This event occurs when Network Interface for use in NCS is not created. This is a temporary event that occurs when a workload is created immediately after template creation or when a workload is created in bulk. The event does not occur after a certain amount of time has elapsed.
* A container event with **IpAddressGenerationFailure** type occurs when the workload is pending
    * This event occurs when there are no more IP addresses available in the specified subnet. You must create Template by changing the CIDR of the subnet or using other subnet.
* Workloads remain pending after changing the workload template
    * You can check the **Event** of the added task to find why the container is not running.
* An event where creating workloads fails due to insufficient resources

| Error Message | Description |
| --- | --- |
| {{.Resource}} Could not create a workload due to insufficient resources. | Could not create a workload due to insufficient resources for NCS environment.<br>Try again after a while or contact the Customer Center. |
| Exceeded the number of {{.Resource}} that can be created. Please contact the Customer Center to increase the limit. | Exceeded the NCS quota for the project.<br>For more details, refer to [NHN Container Service(NCS) Resource Provision Policy](/nhncloud/en/resource-policy/#nhn-container-servicencs). |
